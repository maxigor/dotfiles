Aug 11 01:22:08 <Robdgreat>	it turns out wildcard expansion is an example of expansion
Aug 11 01:22:09 <bullgard4>	Robdgreat, I disagree with your answer. What you write is bash's "parameter expansion" and not the almost 238 times "expansion" use of bash.

Aug 11 01:22:11 <Colere>	bullgard4, as a near-native speaker of the English language, I promise you, this is what the term "expansion" generally means.

Aug 11 01:22:40 <Colere>	In non-technical English, the term "expansion" means "making something bigger".
Aug 11 01:23:00 <Robdgreat>	bullgard4: if you knew the answer, you neednt have asked the question

Aug 15 21:37:00 <Eviruvoc>	"apt full-upgrade" is very similar to "dist-upgrade".  If you've performed "apt upgrade" and noticed that there's some packages that have not been upgraded, that's the safety net of "update".  While "full-update" and "dist-upgrade" will take everything to the latest version.

Aug 15 21:39:14 <Eviruvoc>	Using upgrade keeps to the rule: under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed retrieved and installed. If that's important to you, use apt-get upgrade. If you want things to "just work", you probably want apt-get dist-upgrade to ensure dependencies are resolved.
Aug 15 21:40:09 <blackop>	well debian is stable so it doesnt bring latest kernel or packages anyway
Aug 15 21:40:26 <blackop>	i rely on distro regarding that

Aug 15 21:41:13 <Eviruvoc>	True.  And I've noticed that if I just perform an "upgrade", it often leaves the kernel version intact.  Then I either manually upgrade the package or do a "dist-upgrade".
