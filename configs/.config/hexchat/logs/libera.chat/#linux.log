Aug 11 01:22:08 <Robdgreat>	it turns out wildcard expansion is an example of expansion
Aug 11 01:22:09 <bullgard4>	Robdgreat, I disagree with your answer. What you write is bash's "parameter expansion" and not the almost 238 times "expansion" use of bash.

Aug 11 01:22:11 <Colere>	bullgard4, as a near-native speaker of the English language, I promise you, this is what the term "expansion" generally means.

Aug 11 01:22:40 <Colere>	In non-technical English, the term "expansion" means "making something bigger".
Aug 11 01:23:00 <Robdgreat>	bullgard4: if you knew the answer, you neednt have asked the question

Aug 11 01:23:33 <Andrew>	Expansion is a bit mre of 'touch spammy{1..9}{a..z}' use cases
Aug 11 01:23:42 <Colere>	He didn't say he *knew*, he said he *disagreed*. It's more than possible to express disagreement or doubt without having certain knowledge one way or another.
Aug 11 01:23:51 <bullgard4>	Colere, I do not ask about "non-technical English". Bash is highly technical.
