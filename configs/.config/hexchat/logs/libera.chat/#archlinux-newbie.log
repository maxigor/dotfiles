Aug 15 15:56:57 <DarrylTheFish>	hey guys! I'm trying to make the plex media server read my external hd with movies, but I read something about external drivers that are only allowed to be read by root. how do I change this and get the plex media server to read the movies from the external hard drive?
Aug 15 15:57:42 <gehidore>	setup fstab options or use udisks

Aug 15 16:11:26 <DarrylTheFish>	 gehidore i got rw,relatime,user on my fstab
Aug 15 16:11:54 <gehidore>	user should allow it to be mounted assuming you're referencing it correctly
Aug 15 16:12:08 <gehidore>	you may need to alter permissions of the actual files / directories
Aug 15 16:12:44 <DarrylTheFish>	oh let me try
Aug 15 16:13:11 <gehidore>	so a user should be able to do mount /mountpoint and have it mount
