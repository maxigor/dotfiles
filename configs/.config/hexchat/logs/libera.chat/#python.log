Aug 15 21:33:17 <eyepeetee>	KirkMcDonald - why wouldn't the intention equally be: `dict(d1, x=123, y=456)`
Aug 15 21:33:29 <KirkMcDonald>	This works, certainly.
Aug 15 21:33:56 <eyepeetee>	i just figure it was a tool meant to serve a multitude of purposes like most things, but, you would know better than i do
