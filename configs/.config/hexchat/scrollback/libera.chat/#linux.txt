T 1660191728 18<Robdgreat18>	it turns out wildcard expansion is an example of expansion
T 1660191729 18<bullgard418>	Robdgreat, I disagree with your answer. What you write is bash's "parameter expansion" and not the almost 238 times "expansion" use of bash.

T 1660191731 18<Colere18>	bullgard4, as a near-native speaker of the English language, I promise you, this is what the term "expansion" generally means.
T 1660191760 18<Colere18>	In non-technical English, the term "expansion" means "making something bigger".
T 1660191780 18<Robdgreat18>	bullgard4: if you knew the answer, you neednt have asked the question

T 1660191822 18<Colere18>	He didn't say he *knew*, he said he *disagreed*. It's more than possible to express disagreement or doubt without having certain knowledge one way or another.
T 1660191831 18<bullgard418>	Colere, I do not ask about "non-technical English". Bash is highly technical.
