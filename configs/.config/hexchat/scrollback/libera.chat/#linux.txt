If you've performed "apt upgrade" and noticed that there's some packages that have not been upgraded, that's the safety net of "update".  While "full-update" and "dist-upgrade" will take everything to the latest version.

If that's important to you, use apt-get upgrade. If you want things to "just work", you probably want apt-get dist-upgrade to ensure dependencies are resolved.
T 1660610409 18<blackop18>	well debian is stable so it doesnt bring latest kernel or packages anyway
